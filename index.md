# Welcome

Hey! My name is Nathan Padriga, <u>@ontu</u> online.
Currently an undergraduate student at the University of Florida, studying Computer Science.

Generally interested in cybersecurity, red teaming, reverse engineering, sysadmin work, magic.

Here lies my public respository of tutorials/learning experiences that I found worth writing about.

*Still new to this and as such, site is pretty empty
Hoping to log some new things shortly while I still have free time ðŸ¤ž*
