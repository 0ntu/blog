# Hello World!
*original right?*

This will *hopefully* be one of many blog posts I write here. I'll try to mainly focus on cybersecurity, IT, programming, or any projects I spend a lot of time on. I've been planning on creating something like this for a while now, someplace where I can detail my learning journey and save it for people to get use out of.

Anyway, most of what i write here should be casual and not completely mind-numbing to read (*its not supposed to be an essay afterall*). So, expect some brain dumps, some typos, and off-topic writing in some places.

As for the site itself, it was built with Jekyll using the [jekyll-console-theme](https://github.com/b2a3e8/jekyll-theme-console). I was initially drawn to the [chirpy](https://github.com/cotes2020/jekyll-theme-chirpy) theme, but it seemed way too organized for my liking. Jekyll took me way too long to setup, mostly because I wanted to use Nix with it **as with everything**... If i ever do figure it out, it will definitely be a entry here.

So, welcome! and feel free to take a look around
